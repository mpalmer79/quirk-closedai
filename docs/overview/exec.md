# Executive Brief

## Purpose
Stand up a **closed, on-prem** AI assistant that boosts speed and quality while protecting data and meeting OEM/regulatory requirements.

## Business outcomes (P1)
- 30–50% reduction in handle time for **BDC, Internet Sales, Service Writers**
- Standardized tone across **20 dealerships / 13 brands**
- Fewer escalations via clear, compliant communication
- Centralized SOPs/templates → less tribal knowledge

## Scope (Phase 1)
- Internal copilots (text + voice)  
- Guided forms, summaries, checklists, classification  
- Read-only CRM/DMS adapters (no direct writes)

**Out of scope (P1):** public web access; autonomous actions without review; DMS/CRM mutations.

## Value story
- **Revenue**: faster speed-to-lead, higher set/show rates  
- **Ops**: uniform service notes, parts requests, F&I follow-ups  
- **Risk**: privacy-first, auditable changes, OEM brand controls

## Program KPIs
- Handle-time delta (baseline vs pilot)  
- Lead response quality and booking rates  
- Adoption by department (% active users)  
- QA/Compliance exceptions and rework

## Governance
- PR-based prompt changes, changelog, and prompt tests  
- Data redaction in logs; role-based access  
- Quarterly review of drift / accuracy
