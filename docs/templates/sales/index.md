## Internet Lead – First Response (Email)

```md
Subject: {{FirstName}}, quick info on the {{Year}} {{Make}} {{Model}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Thanks for reaching out about the {{Year}} {{Make}} {{Model}}. We have {{AvailabilitySummary}}.

Highlights:
• {{TrimOrPackage}} — {{KeyFeature1}}, {{KeyFeature2}}
• Trade-in welcome — fast, no-obligation appraisal
• Test drive on your schedule (we’re open {{HoursBrief}})

Would {{AppointmentDayTime}} work for a quick visit? I can have the vehicle pulled up and ready.

Best regards,
{{EmployeeName}}

{{Address}}
{{City}}, {{State}} {{Zip}}
