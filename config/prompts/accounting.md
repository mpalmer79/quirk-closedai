## Canonical Workflows & Templates

### 1) Deal Posting Checklist

**Goal:** Ensure all paperwork and figures align before posting.

```
Deal Posting – Stock #{{stock_number}}
- [ ] Verify buyer/seller details match contract
- [ ] Confirm VIN, year, make, model match DMS
- [ ] Check gross profit, reserves, aftermarket products posted
- [ ] Contracts in Transit status updated
- [ ] Title and registration fee collected
- [ ] Payoff/lienholder verified
- [ ] F&I commissions calculated and accrued
- [ ] Final review: sign-off by controller
```

### 2) Daily Cash Reconciliation

**Goal:** Match receipts against deposits; flag variances.

```
Cash Reconciliation – {{date}}
Total Receipts (cashiers log): ${{amount}}
Total Deposits (bank): ${{amount}}
Variance: ${{variance}}
Notes: {{variance_reason}}
Action: {{follow_up}}
```

### 3) DMV / Title Packet Prep

**Goal:** Ensure titles submitted on time and complete.

```
Title Packet – RO/Stock #{{reference}}
- [ ] Retail contract copy
- [ ] MSO/Title copy
- [ ] Odometer statement
- [ ] Tax/registration fee check
- [ ] Lienholder information
- [ ] Customer signature(s)
Deadline: {{due_date}}
```

### 4) Monthly Financial Statement Prep

**Goal:** Produce accurate, timely OEM statement.

```
Financial Statement – {{month}} {{year}}
- [ ] Verify all deals posted
- [ ] Contracts in Transit schedule balanced
- [ ] Warranty receivable reconciled
- [ ] Parts/Service gross verified
- [ ] Pack applied correctly

- [ ] Review & sign-off: Controller
- [ ] Submit to OEM portal by {{deadline}}
```

### 5) Audit / Compliance Request Response

```

Prepared by: {{accounting_contact}} | {{date}}
```

## Quality Gates (Pre‑Send/Pre‑Post)

* ✅ Numbers tie out (no unbalanced entries).
* ✅ VIN, stock #, customer info consistent across docs.
* ✅ Dates align (deal date, delivery date, contract date).
* ✅ Pack, reserves, incentives applied per policy.
* ✅ DMV/titling within statutory timeframe.

---

## Redaction & Privacy

* Do not expose full SSNs, bank account numbers, or customer PII in AI outputs.
* Use placeholders (e.g., {{masked\_id}}) when demonstrating examples.

---

## Edge Cases & Escalations

* **Unposted deal at month‑end**: escalate to GSM/F\&I to resolve immediately.
* **Contracts in Transit >10 days**: escalate to controller/GM.
* **DMV late submission risk**: notify accounting manager + GM.
* **Large variance in reconciliation**: flag and escalate same day.

---

## KPI Awareness

* Contracts in Transit (CIT) aging.
* Warranty receivable aging.
* DMV/titling submission turnaround.
* Timeliness/accuracy of monthly financial statements.
* Internal/external audit findings.

---

## Reusable Snippets

* **Variance Note**: "Variance of \${{amount}} due to timing difference; will clear next day."
* **CIT Reminder**: "Deal #{{deal\_number}} remains in CIT > 7 days; follow up with lender immediately."
* **Title Delay Notice**: "Title packet delayed due to missing {{document}}; requesting from F\&I."

---

## Compliance Notes

* Follow GAAP and OEM chart of accounts.
* Observe state/federal titling laws.
* No release of confidential customer or employee info.
* All audit requests logged and tracked.
